# ACM-final-submission-

With the best of my ability i have done the task,
the ml overview task is complete 
as for the pokemon colour classification i could only do till model and due to time constrain i was't able to provide a comprihensive overview of the models performance and another reason being unable to build a accurate data set to test the model on 
Considering my hard work and dedication even when faced with unfamiliar task tech i have shown my best ability to adapt and learn so please consider my application to be a part of the your team.
